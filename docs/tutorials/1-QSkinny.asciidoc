== Introduction

=== What is QSkinny?

QSkinny is a UI framework based on the Qt graphic stack and written in
{cpp}. It allows users to write their UIs in {cpp} and/or QML.

It is currently being used in the Fendt Tractor GUI project, see the
picture above. For the Fendt Tractor GUI there is no QML used at all;
the whole codebase is written in {cpp}. An overview of how QSkinny fits
into the Qt architecture is depicted below:

=== Why use QSkinny?

Writing an UI in {cpp} brings all the benefits of the language,
e.g. tooling like valgrind and address sanitizer. In addition, there is
advanced layouting and theming support.

Choosing between QSkinny and QML is not an either/or decision, they can
be mixed and matched. E.g. when writing a UI, some core components could
be written in {cpp} and QSkinny, and some higher level components in QML.
