        content: >-
          QSkinny is written in C++, so its API is similar to QtQWidgets. It is
          based on the modern Qt graphic stack, so its backend is the same as
          the one QML uses.

    content: >-
      QSkinny is at the heart of the Fendt 300 Vario tractor UI. It has proven to successfully
      make its way from a research project to a key software component in a mass production
      vehicle. In the future, the plan is to use QSkinny for more big scale UI projects.
